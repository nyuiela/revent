## Smart Contract Functions

### StreamEventsUpgradeable Contract

```solidity
// Upgrade functions (inherited from UUPSUpgradeable)
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) external payable

// EventTokenManager integration
function setEventTokenManager(address _eventTokenManager) external onlyOwner
function getEventTokenId(uint256 eventId) external view returns (uint256)
function hasEventTokens(uint256 eventId, address holder) external view returns (bool)
function getEventTokenBalance(uint256 eventId, address holder) external view returns (uint256)

// Trusted forwarder management
function setTrustedForwarder(address _trustedForwarder) external onlyOwner
function isTrustedForwarder(address forwarder) external view returns (bool)

// Version and emergency functions
function version() external pure returns (string memory)
function emergencyPause() external onlyOwner
function emergencyUnpause() external onlyOwner
```

### EventTokenManager Contract

```solidity
// Upgrade functions (inherited from UUPSUpgradeable)
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) external payable

// Token management
function mintEventTokens(uint256 eventId, uint256 totalSupply, string memory tokenUri) external
function transferRegistrationToken(uint256 eventId, address attendee, uint256 amount) external

// Query functions
function getEventTokenId(uint256 eventId) external view returns (uint256)
function hasEventTokens(uint256 eventId, address holder) external view returns (bool)
function getEventTokenBalance(uint256 eventId, address holder) external view returns (uint256)
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Deploy StreamEventsUpgradeable

```bash
forge script script/DeployStreamEventsUpgradeable.s.sol --rpc-url <network> --broadcast --verify
```

### 2. Deploy EventTokenManager

```bash
forge script script/DeployEventTokenManager.s.sol --rpc-url <network> --broadcast --verify
```

### 3. Deploy Complete System

```bash
forge script script/DeployCompleteUpgradeableSystem.s.sol --rpc-url <network> --broadcast --verify
```

## Upgrade Process

### 1. Deploy New Implementation

```solidity
// Deploy new implementation contract
StreamEventsUpgradeableV2 newImplementation = new StreamEventsUpgradeableV2();
```

### 2. Upgrade Contract

```solidity
// Upgrade to new implementation
streamEvents.upgradeToAndCall(address(newImplementation), "");
```

### 3. Verify Upgrade

```solidity
// Check new version
string memory newVersion = streamEvents.version();
```

## Usage Examples

### Deploying the System

```solidity
// Deploy complete upgradeable system
DeployCompleteUpgradeableSystem deployer = new DeployCompleteUpgradeableSystem();
deployer.run();
```

### Upgrading Contracts

```solidity
// Upgrade StreamEvents
deployer.upgradeStreamEvents(newStreamEventsImplementation);

// Upgrade EventTokenManager
deployer.upgradeTokenManager(newTokenManagerImplementation);

// Upgrade both contracts
deployer.upgradeBothContracts(newStreamEventsImpl, newTokenManagerImpl);
```

### Checking System Status

```solidity
// Check contract versions
string memory streamEventsVersion = streamEvents.version();
string memory tokenManagerVersion = eventTokenManager.version();

// Check upgrade status
address currentImplementation = streamEvents.implementation();
```

## Upgrade Safety

### ‚úÖ **Data Preservation**

- All existing event data is preserved
- User registrations remain intact
- Token balances are maintained
- Event history is preserved

### ‚úÖ **Function Compatibility**

- Existing functions continue to work
- New functions can be added
- Function signatures can be extended
- Storage layout is preserved

### ‚úÖ **Access Control**

- Only owner can perform upgrades
- Upgrade authorization is required
- All upgrades are logged
- Rollback capability available

## Best Practices

### üîí **Security**

- Always test upgrades on testnets first
- Verify new implementation thoroughly
- Use multi-sig for production upgrades
- Monitor upgrade events

### üìã **Testing**

- Test all existing functionality after upgrade
- Verify data integrity
- Test new features thoroughly
- Check gas usage changes

### üöÄ **Deployment**

streamEvents.emergencyPause();
```

### Emergency Unpause

```solidity
// Resume system after emergency
streamEvents.emergencyUnpause();
```

### Rollback

```solidity
// Rollback to previous implementation
streamEvents.upgradeToAndCall(previousImplementation, "");
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Events to Monitor

```solidity
// Contract upgrade events
event ContractUpgraded(address indexed oldImplementation, address indexed newImplementation);

// EventTokenManager updates
event EventTokenManagerUpdated(address indexed oldManager, address indexed newManager);

// Trusted forwarder updates
event TrustedForwarderUpdated(address indexed oldForwarder, address indexed newForwarder);
```

### Health Checks

- Verify contract functionality after upgrade
- Check event emission
- Validate token operations
- Test user interactions

## Gas Optimization

### Upgrade Costs

- **Implementation Deployment**: ~2M gas
- **Proxy Upgrade**: ~50K gas
- **Data Migration**: 0 gas (automatic)

### Cost Comparison

| Operation    | Non-Upgradeable | Upgradeable |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| Deploy       | 5M gas          | 7M gas      |
| Upgrade      | N/A             | 50K gas     |
| New Features | Redeploy        | Upgrade     |

## Integration Examples

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Check if contract is upgradeable
const isUpgradeable = await streamEvents.hasRole(UPGRADER_ROLE, owner);

// Listen for upgrade events
streamEvents.on("ContractUpgraded", (oldImpl, newImpl) => {
  console.log("Contract upgraded:", oldImpl, "->", newImpl);
});
```

### Backend Integration

```solidity
// Monitor upgrade events
function onUpgrade(address oldImplementation, address newImplementation) external {
    // Update internal references
    // Notify other systems
    // Log upgrade details
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upgrade Authorization Failed**

   - Check if caller is owner
   - Verify `_authorizeUpgrade` implementation

2. **Implementation Not Compatible**

   - Check storage layout compatibility
   - Verify function signatures

3. **Upgrade Transaction Failed**
   - Check gas limits
   - Verify implementation address

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check current implementation
cast call <proxy> "implementation()" --rpc-url <rpc>

# Check contract version
cast call <proxy> "version()" --rpc-url <rpc>

# Check upgrade authorization
cast call <proxy> "owner()" --rpc-url <rpc>
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Multi-sig Upgrade Control**: Require multiple signatures for upgrades
- **Timelock Upgrades**: Add delay before upgrades take effect
- **Upgrade Proposals**: Community voting for upgrades
- **Automatic Rollback**: Automatic rollback on failure

### Advanced Features

- **Hot Swapping**: Upgrade without downtime
- **A/B Testing**: Test new features with subset of users
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable features dynamically
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time upgrade monitoring

This upgradeable system provides maximum flexibility while maintaining security and data integrity, ensuring the event platform can evolve with changing requirements and user needs.
