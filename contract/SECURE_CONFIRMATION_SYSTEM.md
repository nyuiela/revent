# Secure Confirmation Code System

## Overview

The attendance confirmation system has been redesigned to be secure and private. Instead of storing raw confirmation codes on the blockchain (which would be publicly visible), the system now uses a hash-based approach.

## Security Features

### üîí **Hash-Based Storage**

- **Raw confirmation codes are NEVER stored on-chain**
- Only the SHA-256 hash of the confirmation code is stored
- Raw codes are shared off-chain between event creator and attendees

### üîç **How It Works**

1. **Code Generation** (Event Creator):

   ```solidity
   generateEventConfirmationCode(uint256 eventId)
   ```

   - Generates a unique confirmation code
   - Computes `keccak256(bytes(confirmationCode))`
   - Stores only the hash on-chain
   - Emits event with the hash (not the raw code)

2. **Code Verification** (Attendees):

   ```solidity
   confirmAttendance(uint256 eventId, string memory confirmationCode)
   ```

   - Attendee provides the raw confirmation code
   - Contract computes `keccak256(bytes(confirmationCode))`
   - Compares with stored hash
   - Only matches if the code is correct

3. **Attendance Marking** (Event Creator):
   ```solidity
   markAttended(uint256 eventId, address attendeeAddress)
   ```
   - Event creator can mark any registered attendee as attended
   - No prior confirmation required
   - Direct manual process

## Security Benefits

### ‚úÖ **Privacy Protection**

- Raw confirmation codes are never exposed on-chain
- Only event creator and attendees know the actual code
- Blockchain only contains the hash (one-way function)

### ‚úÖ **Tamper Resistance**

- Hash cannot be reversed to get the original code
- Impossible to forge a valid confirmation code
- Only the event creator can generate the initial code

### ‚úÖ **Public Verification**

- Anyone can verify if a confirmation code is valid
- Hash comparison is deterministic and verifiable
- No need to trust the event creator's word

## Usage Flow

### For Event Creators:

1. Call `generateEventConfirmationCode(eventId)` to create a code
2. Share the raw confirmation code with attendees via secure channels
3. Use `markAttended(eventId, attendeeAddress)` to manually mark attendance

### For Attendees:

1. Receive the confirmation code from the event creator
2. Call `confirmAttendance(eventId, confirmationCode)` to confirm
3. Wait for event creator to mark them as attended

## Technical Implementation

### Storage

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public eventConfirmationHashes; // eventId => hash
```

### Events

```solidity
event EventConfirmationCodeGenerated(
    uint256 indexed eventId,
    address indexed creator,
    bytes32 confirmationCodeHash  // Only hash, not raw code
);
```

### Verification

```solidity
require(eventConfirmationHashes[eventId] == keccak256(bytes(confirmationCode)), "Invalid code");
```

## Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Off-Chain Security**

- Event creator must securely share the raw confirmation code
- Use encrypted channels (Signal, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Consider using QR codes for in-person events

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Code Management**

- Confirmation code can only be generated once per event
- Event creator should keep the raw code secure
- Consider using a password manager for storage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Access Control**

- Only event creators can generate confirmation codes
- Only event creators can mark attendance
- Attendees can only confirm their own attendance

## Comparison with Previous System

| Aspect       | Previous (Insecure) | Current (Secure)   |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Storage      | Raw code on-chain   | Hash only on-chain |
| Privacy      | Publicly visible    | Completely private |
| Security     | Vulnerable          | Hash-protected     |
| Verification | Direct comparison   | Hash comparison    |
| Events       | Exposed raw code    | Only hash emitted  |

## Best Practices

1. **Generate codes early**: Create confirmation codes well before the event
2. **Secure sharing**: Use encrypted channels to share codes
3. **Backup storage**: Keep raw codes in secure password manager
4. **Regular verification**: Test the system before the actual event
5. **Clear instructions**: Provide clear instructions to attendees

## Example Integration

```solidity
// Event creator generates code
streamEvents.generateEventConfirmationCode(eventId);

// Attendee confirms with raw code
streamEvents.confirmAttendance(eventId, "EVENT_CONFIRM_12345");

// Event creator marks attendance
streamEvents.markAttended(eventId, attendeeAddress);
```

This system provides maximum security while maintaining ease of use for both event creators and attendees.
