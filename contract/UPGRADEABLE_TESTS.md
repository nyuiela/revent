## Test Commands

### Run All Upgradeable Tests

```bash
forge test --match-path "test/*Upgrade*.t.sol"
```

### Run Individual Test Suites

```bash
# StreamEvents upgrade tests
forge test --match-contract UpgradeableSystemTest

# EventTokenManager upgrade tests
forge test --match-contract EventTokenManagerUpgradeTest

# Complete system upgrade tests
forge test --match-contract CompleteSystemUpgradeTest
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Test specific functionality
forge test --match-test "testStreamEventsUpgrade"
forge test --match-test "testDataPreservation"
forge test --match-test "testUpgradeAuthorization"
```

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **Basic Upgrade Flow**

```solidity
// Deploy implementation
StreamEventsUpgradeableV2 newImpl = new StreamEventsUpgradeableV2(trustedForwarder);

// Upgrade contract
streamEvents.upgradeToAndCall(address(newImpl), "");

// Verify upgrade
assertEq(streamEvents.version(), "2.0.0");
assertEq(StreamEventsUpgradeableV2(address(streamEvents)).newFeature(), "New feature from V2");
```

### 2. **Data Preservation**

```solidity
// Set data before upgrade
streamEvents.setEventTokenManager(tokenManagerAddress);
streamEvents.setTrustedForwarder(forwarderAddress);

// Perform upgrade
streamEvents.upgradeToAndCall(address(newImpl), "");

// Verify data preservation
assertEq(streamEvents.eventTokenManager(), tokenManagerAddress);
assertEq(streamEvents.trustedForwarderAddr(), forwarderAddress);
```

### 3. **Access Control**

```solidity
// Try to upgrade as non-owner (should fail)
vm.prank(user1);
vm.expectRevert();
streamEvents.upgradeToAndCall(address(newImpl), "");

// Upgrade as owner (should succeed)
streamEvents.upgradeToAndCall(address(newImpl), "");
```

### 4. **Integration Testing**

```solidity
// Test token functionality after upgrade
vm.prank(address(streamEvents));
eventTokenManager.mintEventTokens(eventId, totalSupply, tokenUri);

vm.prank(address(streamEvents));
eventTokenManager.transferRegistrationToken(eventId, user1, 1);

// Verify functionality
assertTrue(eventTokenManager.hasEventTokens(eventId, user1));
assertEq(eventTokenManager.getEventTokenBalance(eventId, user1), 1);
```
